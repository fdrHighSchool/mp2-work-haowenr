# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**


2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
  I can make the program to count its total amount of substring and if its 3 unit its 100


3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
  If the returned number is under 65 make it give an F
